      <h1>Private, Encrypted Email - Based in the Netherlands</h1>
      <p>ANONAMAIL is a privacy-first email service designed for users who prioritize confidentiality and control over their communications. We combine strong cryptographic protections, limited data retention policies, and transparent operational practices to offer an email service that minimizes exposure of personal information while remaining reliable and easy to use.</p>

  <h2>What We Protect</h2>
  <p>We focus on protecting the content of your messages and the minimal metadata necessary to deliver mail. Our protections include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>End-to-end encryption:</strong> Messages are encrypted so only intended recipients can read them where feasible.</li>
    <li><strong>Minimal logging:</strong> We retain the smallest amount of metadata required for service operation and abuse handling.</li>
    <li><strong>Data residency:</strong> All primary servers and backups are hosted in the Netherlands to benefit from strong legal safeguards for user privacy.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to Register</h2>
  <p>To request an account, contact our registration bot on Telegram: <strong>@bot_anonamailorg</strong>. In your message, briefly state the intended use of the account (personal, business, project, etc.). We review requests to ensure responsible use of the service and to protect the safety of our users. Typical approval time is 24–72 hours depending on volume.</p>
